The BrainSQL eCampus Learning Management System provides an ideal solution for running an online educational resource site, rather it be a full online university, an individual course, or a tutorial-based site.

The system is similar to applications such as Moodle & aTutor, but offers additional features to both the end-user (student), administrators and course instructors.

In addition to offering course management, the system also has a set of features that allow for the management of students, educators and other resources, so it's a full-fledged eCampus solution that allows for the full management of an online learning organization, rather than just providing a platform for eLearning.

Please see the "Downloads" sections to view additional information regarding this project, including an outline of features for administrators, students, and teachers. Developers guides are also available for those who would like to contribute to this project.
